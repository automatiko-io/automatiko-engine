= Workflow as a Service

image::workflow-as-service.png[]

Workflow as a service brings an idea of modeling a service as a workflow.
In this scenario a workflow is exposed as a fully featured service with a dedicated (domain specific) API.
Workflow as a Service aims to cover more traditional service deployments that usually
consists of:

- a service API exposed over `http/rest`
- an `OpenAPI` definition for describing services to simplify their use
- taking advantage of various integration mechanism to be able to exchange data with
different services/systems
- ability to be either short lived or long running

In addition, GraphQL service interface can also be added to enhance capabilities of the service.

Workflow as a Service does not really differ from any other developed service. The main
advantage it provides is the ability to use the mentioned well established and known
workflow languages such as BPMN and DMN as programming languages. Other
features are for the most part very similar to those that could be
coded by hand.

== Get started

To get started with Workflow as a Service users can take advantage of ready to use maven archetypes
to generate the project structure

- *automatiko-archetype* - Generic project type that comes with basic setup

- *automatiko-orchestration-archetype* - Tailored for service orchestration scenarios 

- *automatiko-event-stream-archetype* - Tailored project type for event stream use case backed by Apache Kafka

- *automatiko-iot-archetype* - Tailored project type for IoT use case backed by MQTT

- *automatiko-db-archetype* - Tailored project type for database record processing use case

- *automatiko-batch-archetype* - Tailored project type for batch processing use case


Here is a ready to use command to generate project based on *automatiko-orchestration-archetype*

[source,plain]
----
mvn archetype:generate                                      \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.automatiko.archetypes               \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=automatiko-orchestration-archetype  \
  -DarchetypeVersion=LATEST                                 \
  -DgroupId=com.acme.workflows                              \
  -DartifactId=workfow-service
----

== Configure project

Once the project is bootstrapped, it needs to be configured according to the needs. There are two places where 
configuration is done

- `pom.xml` - definition of the dependencies and Automatiko addons to be used
- `application.properties` - all configuration parameters are defined there (found in `src/main/resources` directory)

A complete configuration of Automatiko specific configuration parameters can be found here, Quarkus specific configuration
parameters can be found here.

== Examples
