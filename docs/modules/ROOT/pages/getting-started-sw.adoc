= Getting started based on Serverless Workflow

TIP: Best place to start is by trying the link:examples.html[examples]
that will let you feel the Automatiko in action before getting your hands dirty
 ... just in case you haven't tried them yet

Here you can find all that is needed to get you started with Automatiko

== Quick tour

The only software required to get a quick tour of Serverless Workflow with Automatiko is Docker/Podman.

TIP: Usuful is also to get the VisualStudio Code with Serverless Extension to be guided when working with DSL.
See *Required tooling* section.

1. Create directory where you are going to store your workflow definition files
+	
.Linux
+	
[source,bash]
----
mkdir workflows
cd workflows
----
+	
.Windows
+	
[source,bash]
----
md workflows
cd workflows
----

2. Create your first serverless workflow definition file
+
IMPORTANT: file extension must be either `.sw.json` or `.sw.yaml`
+
Here is a hello world example in Serverless Workflow DSL
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "hellowworld",
  "version": "1.0",
  "specVersion": "0.8",
  "name": "Hello World Workflow",
  "description": "Hello World",
   "start": "Hello",
   "states": [
        {
            "name": "Hello",
            "type": "inject",
            "data": {
                "message": "Hello World"
            },
            "end": true
        }   
    ]
}

----

3. Start automatiko development container and mount the current folder to the workflows directory
+	
.Linux
+	
[source,bash]
----
docker run -v $(pwd):/app/src/main/resources/workflows -p 8080:8080 -it --rm automatiko/development-container:latest
----
+	
.Windows
+	
[source,bash]
----
docker run -v %cd%:/app/src/main/resources/workflows -p 8080:8080 -it --rm automatiko/development-container:latest
----

Once the container is started you should see similar output

image::getting-started-vscode-example.png[]

  
Workflow files are processed automatically and will be available for execution. There are two endpoints that will
 allow you to inspect what is in your service
 
 - OpenAPI definition with Swagger UI can be found at: http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui[http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui]
+
image::getting-started-sw-swagger.png[]

 - Process management UI can be found at: http://localhost:8080/management/processes/ui[http://localhost:8080/management/processes/ui]
+
image::getting-started-sw-process-mgmt.png[]

and you can start instances of that workflow with following curl command

[source,bash]
----

curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:8080/v1_0/hellowworld' -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
----

=== Working with events

When working with events either received or produced by the workflow there must be actual broker or endpoint 
where events should be received from or sent to. To make this simple for development and try out use cases
users can simply put URLs to the broker/endpoint

- `KAFKA_URL` that should be a valid bootstrap servers of the Apache Kafka cluster
- `AMQP_URL` that should be a host:port to the AMQP broker
- `HTTP_URL` that should be a complete http/https URL to be used to publish events

These URLs should be given when starting the development container as environment variables

.Linux
	
[source,bash]
----
docker run -v $(pwd):/app/src/main/resources/workflows -e KAFKA_URL=mykafkahost:9092 -p 8080:8080 -it --rm automatiko/development-container:latest
----
	
.Windows
	
[source,bash]
----
docker run -v %cd%:/app/src/main/resources/workflows -e KAFKA_URL=mykafkahost:9092 -p 8080:8080 -it --rm automatiko/development-container:latest
----

This will configure Kafka based eventing support. Events produced and consumed will be published to a topics 
that are named based on event names from workflow definition.

=== Enabling persistence

To enable persistence, so long running workflow instances are persisted, additional environment variable
needs to be set when starting developer container. 

There are three options available

- `MONGO_URL` to configure MongoDB as backend storage
- `CASSANDRA_URL` to configure Apache Cassandra as backend storage
- `FS_URL` to use local file system as backend storage

[source,bash]
----
docker run -v $(pwd):/app/src/main/resources/workflows -e MONGO_URL=mongodb://mymongohost:27017 -p 8080:8080 -it --rm automatiko/development-container:latest
----
	
.Windows
	
[source,bash]
----
docker run -v %cd%:/app/src/main/resources/workflows -e MONGO_URL=mongodb://mymongohost:27017 -p 8080:8080 -it --rm automatiko/development-container:latest
----

This concludes the quick tour of using Automatiko based on Serverless Workflow.

Below sections provides more details setup to configure your local development environment with all tools 
needed to build fully featured services based on workflow definitions.

== Required software

Following are the required software before you can get started with Automatiko

- Java (version 17 or higher)
- Apache Maven (version 3.8 or higher)

In addition, following are good to have though they are not mandatory

- Docker/Podman
- GraalVM
- Kubernetes like environment (MiniKube, OpenShift, K3s/K3d)

== Required tooling

Automatiko takes advantage of Serverless Workflow specification and its tools. Due to that
it is recommended to use VisualStudio Code with Serverless Workflow Extension that helps to create workflow 
definition.

== Create project

Automatiko comes with number of archetypes that allow to easily create project
with preconfigured set of dependencies needed for given use case

.Automatiko archetypes
|====
|Name | Description

|automatiko-archetype
|Generic project type that comes with basic setup

|automatiko-orchestration-archetype
|Tailored for service orchestration scenarios

|automatiko-event-stream-archetype
|Tailored project type for event stream use case backed by Apache Kafka

|automatiko-iot-archetype
|Tailored project type for IoT use case backed by MQTT

|automatiko-batch-archetype
|Tailored project type for batch processing use case

|automatiko-function-archetype
|Tailored project type for workflow as a function use case

|automatiko-function-flow-archetype
|Tailored project type for function flow use case backed by KNative

|automatiko-operator-archetype
|Tailored project type for building Kubernetes Operators

|====

Select archetype that matches the best for the type of automation you're going
to work with.

Use following command to generate project based on *automatiko-orchestration-archetype*

[source,plain]
----
mvn archetype:generate                                      \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.automatiko.archetypes               \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=automatiko-orchestration-archetype  \
  -DarchetypeVersion=LATEST                                 \
  -DgroupId=com.acme.workflows                              \
  -DartifactId=workfow-service
----

It is standard Maven folder structure so should be rather familiar to most people
but to just highlight most important parts of it

* pom.xml - configuration of the project that is
** Maven coordinates (group artifact version)
** Name and description
** Dependencies
** Profiles
* `src/main/java` folder where all java classes should be created
* `src/main/resources`
** folder where application configuration is located - `application.properties`
** folder where all business assets such as workflow or decision files are to be created
* `src/test/java` folder where all test related java classes should be created
* `src/test/resources` folder where all test related additional files should be created

== Create workflow file

Create new workflow file by using VSCode File menu option `New File` and use either
`.sw.json` or `.sw.yaml` file extensions

Define your workflow with Serverless Workflow DSL

== Local execution mode

Once you're ready (at least to get it running) with your workflow run a local
execution mode (development mode) by issuing following command in the top level
folder of your project

`mvn clean quarkus:dev`

This will launch (after sometime when executed for the first time...) a service
that will have REST api available at link:http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui[]

At this point you can use swagger ui to try out your newly built service
from the workflow.

While the service is running you can start modifying the workflow without
the need to restart the service. In Local execution mode changes are reflected
directly after saving file and issuing another request to the service.

WARNING: Live reload is still considered as experimental feature so please
report issues in case you run into problems.

== Create test case for the workflow

It's really important to make sure that the service build from workflow is
working as expected and the best way to do that is by testing it.

Automatiko allows you to easily write tests against the service interface
regardless if the entry point to the service is

- REST/Http
- Kafka Broker
- MQTT broker
- File polling
- and more

All of them can be tested that will be part of the build to make sure only
valid (tested) service will be eligible for deployment.

Testing mainly focuses on verifying the service interface and the most simple
one would look like the below

[source]
----
@QuarkusTest // <1>
public class VerificationTests {

    @Test
    public void testProcessNotVersioned() {
        // start new instance with below payload
        String addPayload = "{\"name\" : \"john\"}";// <2>
        given()
          .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
          .accept(ContentType.JSON)
          .body(addPayload)
          .when()
              .post("/greetings")
          .then()
              //.log().body(true)
              .statusCode(200)
              .body("id", notNullValue(), "name", equalTo("john"), "message", equalTo("Hello john"), "lastName", nullValue());// <3>
        // since this is straight through workflow it should directly complete
        given()
            .accept(ContentType.JSON)
        .when()
            .get("/greetings")
        .then().statusCode(200)
            .body("$.size()", is(0));// <4>
    }
  }
----

<1> Declare on class level that this is a `@QuarkusTest`
<2> Create JSON payload that will represent the input of workflow instance
<3> Send HTTP POST request and verify the response body
<4> Lastly send another HTTP request (GET) to see if there are any active instances

This just illustrates how workflow testing looks like, more advanced test cases
can be found

== Build

Building the service depends on the type of output you're interested in

=== Build executable jar

To build executable jar issue following command

`mvn clean package`

after build completes there will be `{artifactId-version}-runner.jar`
in the `target` directory. You can easily execute this service by

`java -jar target/{artifactId-version}-runner.jar`

=== Build native image

IMPORTANT: To build native image a GraalVM is required.

To build native image issue following command

`mvn clean package -Pnative`

WARNING: Native image compilation is heavy operation and resource hungry
so don't be surprised it takes time and the computer is "really" busy...

after build completes there will be `{artifactId-version}-runner`
in the `target` directory. You can easily execute this service by

`./target/{artifactId-version}-runner`

=== Build container image

To build container image issue following command

`mvn clean package -Pcontainer`

after build completes there will be image created in local container registry.
You can easily execute this service by

`docker run -p 8080:8080 {username}/{artifactId}:{version}`

replace the username, artifact and version with OS user, adrtifactId of your project
and version of your project.

TIP: Various configuration options can be specified which are based on
Quarkus so have a look at link:https://quarkus.io/guides/container-image#customizing[Config Options]


=== Build container image with native executable

To build container image with native executable issue following command

`mvn clean package -Pcontainer-native`

after build completes there will be image created in local container registry.
You can easily execute this service by

`docker run -p 8080:8080 {username}/{artifactId}:{version}`

replace the username, artifact and version with OS user, adrtifactId of your project
and version of your project.

TIP: Various configuration options can be specified which are based on
Quarkus so have a look at link:https://quarkus.io/guides/container-image#customizing[Config Options]


=== Build container image for Kubernetes

To build container image issue following command

`mvn clean package -Pkubernetes`

after build completes there will image created in local container registry.
Depending where is your Kubernetes environment there might be a need to push
the image to external registry.

As part of the build there are Kubernetes descriptor files created to help
with deployment, they can be found in `target/kubernetes` directory

TIP: Various configuration options can be specified which are based on
Quarkus so have a look at link:https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#configuration-options[Config Options]
