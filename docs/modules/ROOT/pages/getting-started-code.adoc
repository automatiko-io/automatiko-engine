= Getting started based on Java DSL


Java DSL of Automatiko allows developers to define their workflows as Java code. This is another 
alternative to BPMN (visual modeling) and Serverless Workflow (json and yaml). The main advantage is
that there is nothing else then regular IDE required. 

Java DSL follows fluent API pattern to provide easy to write and easy to read domain specific language 
to express the workflow definition. At the same time it aims at building fully type based so all 
code that is going to be executed by workflow is given as code rather than string representation of it.

NOTE: All described examples below can be found in https://github.com/automatiko-io/automatiko-examples/workflows-java-dsl[Automatiko Examples repository]

== Required software

Following are the required software before you can get started with Automatiko

- Java (version 11 or higher)
- Apache Maven (version 3.6.3 or higher)

In addition, following are good to have though they are not mandatory

- Docker
- GraalVM
- Kubernetes like environment (MiniKube, OpenShift, K3s/K3d)

== Create project

Automatiko comes with number of archetypes that allow to easily create project
with preconfigured set of dependencies needed for given use case

.Automatiko archetypes
|====
|Name | Description

|automatiko-archetype
|Generic project type that comes with basic setup

|automatiko-orchestration-archetype
|Tailored for service orchestration scenarios

|automatiko-event-stream-archetype
|Tailored project type for event stream use case backed by Apache Kafka

|automatiko-iot-archetype
|Tailored project type for IoT use case backed by MQTT

|automatiko-db-archetype
|Tailored project type for database record processing use case

|automatiko-batch-archetype

|====

Select archetype that matches the best for the type of automation you're going
to work with. 

Use following command to generate project based on *automatiko-orchestration-archetype*

----
mvn archetype:generate                                      \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.automatiko.archetypes               \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=automatiko-orchestration-archetype  \

It is standard Maven folder structure so should be rather familiar to most people
but to just highlight most important parts of it

* pom.xml - configuration of the project that is
** Maven coordinates (group artifact version)
** Name and description
** Dependencies
** Profiles
* `src/main/java` folder where all java classes should be created
* `src/main/resources`
** folder where application configuration is located - `application.properties`
** folder where all business assets such as workflow or decision files are to be created
* `src/test/java` folder where all test related java classes should be created
* `src/test/resources` folder where all test related additional files should be created

== Create workflow definitions

Workflow definitions created via Java DSL should be placed in class that is annotated with 
`io.automatiko.engine.api.Workflows`. Each public method that returns `io.automatiko.engine.workflow.builder.WorkflowBuilder`
is considered a new workflow definition.

Below is the hello world example of workflow definition with Java DSL

[source,java]
----
@Workflows
public class MyWorkflows {

    public WorkflowBuilder helloWorld() {

        WorkflowBuilder builder = WorkflowBuilder.newWorkflow("hello", "Sample Hello World workflow", "1")
                .dataObject("name", String.class);
                
                builder
                .start("start here").then()
                .log("say hello", "Hello world").then()
                .end("done");

        return builder;
    }
 }
----

That is all needed to build the workflow via Java DSL that is then processed at build time as any other 
workflow format (e.g. BPMN) and a fully featured service is built from it.

Let's look at different workflow constructs that can be used.

=== Branching execution

A very common use case is to split the execution within the workflow based on conditions.

Java DSL supports following types

- exclusive based on data object conditions - only one path is taken
- inclusive based on data object conditions - multiple paths can be taken
- parallel - all paths are taken
- event based - reacts to incoming events - only one path is taken of the event that arrived first

[source,java]
----
@Workflows
public class MyWorkflows {

    public WorkflowBuilder split() {

		WorkflowBuilder builder = WorkflowBuilder.newWorkflow("split", "Sample workflow with exclusive split");

        String x = builder.dataObject(String.class, "x");
        String y = builder.dataObject(String.class, "y");

        SplitNodeBuilder split = builder.start("start here").then()
                .log("log values", "X is {} and Y is {}", "x", "y")
                .thenSplit("split");

        split.when(() -> x != null).log("first branch", "first branch").then().end("done on first");

        split.when(() -> y != null).log("second branch", "second branch").then().end("done on second");

        return builder;
    }
 }
----

In addition to splitting the execution, another common need is to be able to join (also referred to as merge) of 
multiple execution paths. Here is similar to split, there are different types

- exclusive - waits for only one path
- inclusive - waits for all path that are active
- parallel - waits for all paths
 
 
[source,java]
----
@Workflows
public class MyWorkflows {

    public WorkflowBuilder splitAndJoin() {

		WorkflowBuilder builder = WorkflowBuilder.newWorkflow("splitAndJoin", "Sample workflow with exclusive split and join");

        String x = builder.dataObject(String.class, "x");
        String y = builder.dataObject(String.class, "y");

        SplitNodeBuilder split = builder.start("start here").then()
                .log("log values", "X is {} and Y is {}", "x", "y")
                .thenSplit("split");

        JoinNodeBuilder join = split.when(() -> x != null).log("first branch", "first branch").thenJoin("join");

        split.when(() -> y != null).log("second branch", "second branch").thenJoin("join");

        join.then().log("after join", "joined").then().end("done");

        return builder;
    }
 }
---- 

IMPORTANT: Join relies on the name to be able to correlate paths properly so if you want to join different paths
 via the same join node always use the same name e.g. `.thenJoin("join")`
 
And last sample workflow is to use event based split that will wait either for message arrival or timeout

[source,java]
----
@Workflows
public class MyWorkflows {

    public WorkflowBuilder splitOnEvents() {

		WorkflowBuilder builder = WorkflowBuilder.newWorkflow("splitOnEvents", "Sample workflow with exclusive split on events")
		.dataObject("customer", Customer.class);

		EventSplitNodeBuilder split = builder.start("start here").then()
				.log("log", "About to wait for events")
                .thenSplitOnEvents("wait for events");

        split.onMessage("events").toDataObject("customer").then().log("after message", "Message arrived").then()
                .end("done on message");
        split.onTimer("timeout").after(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS).then().log("after timeout", "Timer fired").then()
                .end("done on timeout");

        return builder;
    }
 }
---- 

IMPORTANT: This workflow uses message events and by that requires additional dependency in the project. Add
`io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka` to the project `pom.xml` to have fully working example


=== Invoking services

Workflow in most of the cases will delegate the execution to other services, either local (java service methods)
or external (REST invocation). For this exact purpose a service node is available in Java DSL.

[source,java]
----
@Workflows
public class MyWorkflows {

    public WorkflowBuilder serviceCall() {

		WorkflowBuilder builder = WorkflowBuilder.newWorkflow("service", "Sample workflow calling local service", "1")
                .dataObject("name", String.class, INPUT_TAG)
                .dataObject("greeting", String.class, OUTPUT_TAG)
                .dataObject("age", Integer.class);

        ServiceNodeBuilder service = builder.start("start here").then()
                .log("execute script", "Hello world").then()
                .service("greet");

        service.toDataObject("greeting",
                service.type(MyService.class).sayHello(service.fromDataObject("name"))).then()
                .end("that's it");

        return builder;
    }
 }
---- 

Few important aspects to note here:

- use of `service.type(clazz)` returns an instance of the service that provides access to its methods so
definition can be fully type safe and checked by the compiler
- same foes for parameters that rely on `service.fromDataObject(name)` that will fetch the given data object 
and use it as parameter of the method at runtime
- lastly, use of `service.toDataObject(name, value)` is setting the value of the given data object to the 
value returned from the service method call


In similar way, a REST service call can be made with following workflow definition

[source,java]
----
@Workflows
public class MyWorkflows {

    public WorkflowBuilder restServiceCall() {

		WorkflowBuilder builder = WorkflowBuilder.newWorkflow("restService", "Sample workflow calling REST service", "1")
                .dataObject("petId", Long.class, INPUT_TAG)
                .dataObject("pet", Object.class, OUTPUT_TAG);

        RestServiceNodeBuilder service = builder.start("start here").then()
                .log("execute script", "Hello world").then()
                .restService("get pet from the store");

        service.toDataObject("pet",
                service.openApi("/api/swagger.json").operation("getPetById").fromDataObject("petId")).then()
                .end("that's it");

		service.onError("404").then().log("log error", "Unable to find pet with id {}", "petId").then().end("not found");

        return builder;
    }
 }
---- 

This workflow will take the OpenAPI definition and reference its operation based on given id. 
Then it will create RestClient to invoke it and pass given parameters. Result can be easily mapped 
back to data object.


=== Assigning work to human actors

In some situations there is a need to involve human actors in the course of workflow execution. This is where 
there must be import given, decision made and so on. Java DSL exposes that capability via `user` builder that
can be used in following way

[source,java]
----
@Workflows
public class MyWorkflows {

    public WorkflowBuilder userTasks() {

		WorkflowBuilder builder = WorkflowBuilder.newWorkflow("userTasks", "Sample workflow with user tasks")
                .dataObject("x", Integer.class)
                .dataObject("y", String.class);

        builder.start("start here").then()
        	.user("FirstTask").description("A description of the task")
        			.users("john").outputToDataObject("value", "y").then()
            .user("SecondTask").users("john").dataObjectAsInput("x").then()
            .end("done");

        return builder;
    }
 }
---- 

User node allows to assign users and groups that will allow such users and members of the group to work on the
task. In addition, data objects can be mapped as inputs and then outputs of the user node can be mapped back 
to data objects for further processing. 

Since this is the user facing activity, optionally form template can also be developed and then referenced by name
using the `form` method of the builder.

=== Sending and receiving messages

IMPORTANT: This workflow uses message events and by that requires additional dependency in the project. Add
`io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-kafka` to the project `pom.xml` to have fully working example


Interaction with external world is also very common, sending and receiving various types of messages can 
be defined in the workflow via Java DSL in following way

[source,java]
----
@Workflows
public class MyWorkflows {

    public WorkflowBuilder receiveAndSendMessages() {

		WorkflowBuilder builder = WorkflowBuilder.newWorkflow("messages", "Workflow with messages");
        				builder.dataObject("customer", Customer.class)
                .startOnMessage("customers").toDataObject("customer").topic("org.acme.customers")
                .then()
                .sendMessage("new message").fromDataObject("customer").topic("published")
                .then()
                .log("log message", "Logged customer with id {}", "customer")
                .then()
                .waitOnMessage("updates").toDataObject("customer")
                .then()
                .endWithMessage("done").fromDataObject("customer");

        return builder;
    }
 }
---- 

This workflow will be triggered by a message that arrives at topic called `org.acme.customers` and will be 
unmarshalled into the `Customer` from `JSON` structure (this is the default expectations that the message body 
is in JSON format).

Next, another message will be sent to `published` topic with payload being the customer data object serialized to 
JSON.

Then it will wait for another message to be sent to `updates` topic (it is taken from the name of the node if topic is 
not explicitly given) and here it needs to be correlated. The correlation is taken from the message and is specific to 
connector in use. For example for Apache Kafka, the key of the Kafka record will be taken as correlation key.

Lastly, upon completion it will send another message to `done` topic with payload of customer data object in JSON 
format. This will end the workflow instance.

=== And more

There are other constructs available such as 

- sub workflows
- timers
- expressions

that can be used via Java DSL of Automatiko workflows. Have a look a the API of `WorkflowBuilder` to know more.  

== Build

Building the service depends on the type of output you're interested in

=== Build executable jar

To build executable jar issue following command

`mvn clean package`

after build completes there will be `{artifactId-version}-runner.jar`
in the `target` directory. You can easily execute this service by

`java -jar target/{artifactId-version}-runner.jar`

=== Build native image

IMPORTANT: To build native image a GraalVM is required.

To build native image issue following command

`mvn clean package -Pnative`

WARNING: Native image compilation is heavy operation and resource hungry
so don't be surprised it takes time and the computer is "really" busy...

after build completes there will be `{artifactId-version}-runner`
in the `target` directory. You can easily execute this service by

`./target/{artifactId-version}-runner`

=== Build container image

To build container image issue following command

`mvn clean package -Pcontainer`

after build completes there will be image created in local container registry.
You can easily execute this service by

`docker run -p 8080:8080 {username}/{artifactId}:{version}`

replace the username, artifact and version with OS user, adrtifactId of your project
and version of your project.

TIP: Various configuration options can be specified which are based on
Quarkus so have a look at link:https://quarkus.io/guides/container-image#customizing[Config Options]


=== Build container image with native executable

To build container image with native executable issue following command

`mvn clean package -Pcontainer-native`

after build completes there will be image created in local container registry.
You can easily execute this service by

`docker run -p 8080:8080 {username}/{artifactId}:{version}`

replace the username, artifact and version with OS user, adrtifactId of your project
and version of your project.

TIP: Various configuration options can be specified which are based on
Quarkus so have a look at link:https://quarkus.io/guides/container-image#customizing[Config Options]


=== Build container image for Kubernetes

To build container image issue following command

`mvn clean package -Pkubernetes`

after build completes there will image created in local container registry.
Depending where is your Kubernetes environment there might be a need to push
the image to external registry.

As part of the build there are Kubernetes descriptor files created to help
with deployment, they can be found in `target/kubernetes` directory

TIP: Various configuration options can be specified which are based on
Quarkus so have a look at link:https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes#configuration-options[Config Options]
