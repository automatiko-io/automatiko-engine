= Receive Email


Email message received can be automatically converted to an object of type `io.automatiko.engine.addons.services.receiveemail.EmailMessage`
that has following properties

- from - from address
- replyTo - reply to address if found
- to - list of TO recipients as string
- cc - list of CC recipients as string
- bcc - list of BCC recipients as string
- subject - email subject
- body - string representation of the email body
- attachments - list of attachments if found any in the email (of type `io.automatiko.engine.api.workflow.files.File<byte[]>`


NOTE: In case you can to extract more from the email message than what is provided out of the box
then you should define new type and implement `io.automatiko.engine.api.io.InputConverter<T>` for that type.

In addition to automatic email conversion to a java object, there is also a function (that will be made available
to your workflow definition) that can be used for correlating emails to proper workflow instances.

That function is `replyMessageId(message)` it takes the received message and extracts the correlation attribute that
is actually based on the `In-Reply-To` header of the email. This goes hand in hand with sending correlated email
that will attach proper information to be able to use it on both ends.

Use of this function is via `corrrelationExpression` of the message within workflow definition. 
See <<../../components/messaging.adoc#_correlation,correlation section in Messaging>> for more details.

And here is an example how it can be used
