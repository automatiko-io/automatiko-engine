= Send Email

Send Email addon service comes with support for sending emails.
It provides `io.automatiko.engine.addons.services.email.SendEmailService` that comes with
following operations

- `send` with given body
- `send` with template based body

NOTE: Regardless of the operation type, recipients (both `TO` and `CC`) can be given as list of comma
separated addresses e.g. `john@email.com,mary@email.com` 

== Send with given body operation

Send email with given body is based on complete body to be given to the operation
and thus it will not perform any modification to it. 

There are two flavors of the operation that differs in the set of recipients
- sending only to main recipients (TO)
- sending to both main recipients and CC recipients


=== Data mapping

When used via service task this service expects following data mapping

* Inputs
** to - one or more email addresses of recipients
** cc - one or more CC email recipients - this can be completely omitted
** subject - subject of the email message
** body - complete body of the email message

Optionally as last inputs attachments can be given. There maybe 0 or more 
attachments and they should be of type `io.automatiko.engine.api.workflow.files.File`

There are no outputs to be defined.

=== On success
Successful operation will not produce any results

=== On failure
Failure during creation of the archive will throw a `io.automatiko.engine.api.workflow.ServiceExecutionError`
with error code `sendEmailFailure` so it can be used within workflow definition to handle errors 

== Send with template based body operation

Send email with template based body is based on generating email body based on given template (identified
by name) and the context object. Both must be given to properly produce and send email.

There are two flavors of the operation that differs in the set of recipients
- sending only to main recipients (TO)
- sending to both main recipients and CC recipients

When creating templates (usually html files) to refer to context object use `body` variable. 
Following examples shows how to access name of the person that is given as context object:

[source,html]
----
<html>
  <body>

	<h1>Hello {body.name}</h1>
	
	<p>Here is a bit of information for you!</p>
  </body>
</html>
----

All templates must be stored in `templates` folder under `src/main/resources` of your project.

=== Data mapping

When used via service task this service expects following data mapping

* Inputs
** to - one or more email addresses of recipients
** cc - one or more CC email recipients - this can be completely omitted
** subject - subject of the email message
** template - name of the template to be used to generate email body
** body - a context object that will be given as `body` into the template generation

Optionally as last inputs attachments can be given. There maybe 0 or more 
attachments and they should be of type `io.automatiko.engine.api.workflow.files.File`

There are no outputs to be defined.

=== On success
Successful operation will not produce any results.

=== On failure
Failure during creation of the archive will throw a `io.automatiko.engine.api.workflow.ServiceExecutionError`
with error code 

- `sendEmailFailure` 
- `emailTemplateNotFound`

so it can be used within workflow definition to handle errors 


== Usage

To be able to use this service addon a project must be given following dependency


[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.automatiko.addons.services</groupId>
  <artifactId>automatiko-send-email-addon</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

There is a need to provide email server configuration via `application.properties` file

[source,plain]
----
quarkus.mailer.auth-methods=DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-SHA256 CRAM-SHA1 CRAM-MD5 PLAIN LOGIN
quarkus.mailer.from=YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com
quarkus.mailer.host=smtp.gmail.com
quarkus.mailer.port=587
quarkus.mailer.start-tls=REQUIRED
quarkus.mailer.username=YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com
quarkus.mailer.password=PASSWORD

Declare service interface

image::declare-interface.png[]

Configure service task interface

image::email-1.png[]

Configure parameters to invoke (in this case the `send` operation with template names `notifications`)

image::email-2.png[]

In this example

- email is sent to address taken from workflow instance variable called `email`
- with subject set to `Notifications` 
- body is generated based on template named `notifications` and the `person` workflow instance variable is given as context to template generation
- `documents` workflow instance variable is used as attachment to the email (in this case a `zip` file)
