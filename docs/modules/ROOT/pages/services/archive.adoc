= Archive

Archive addon service comes with support for working with file archives (`zip files`).
It provides `io.automatiko.engine.addons.services.archive.ArchiveService` that comes with
following operations

- `zip` to build archives based on set of files
- `unzip` to extract files from given archive and return as set of files 

== Zip operation

Zip operation allows to build an archive that is named and contains 
given set of files. The files should be any type implementing 
`io.automatiko.engine.api.workflow.files.File` interface with type of content of `byte[]` type.

It also expects to have given a name that will be set on the archive.

=== Data mapping

When used via service task this service expects following data mapping

* Inputs
** name - name of the archive
** file1 - file to be included in the archive
** file..N - additional files to be included in the archive

* Output
** archive - variable where the produced archive should be set to

=== On success
Successful creation will return `io.automatiko.engine.addons.services.archive.Archive` instance.

=== On failure
Failure during creation of the archive will throw a `io.automatiko.engine.api.workflow.ServiceExecutionError`
with error code `zipFailure` so it can be used within workflow definition to handle errors 

== Unzip operation

Unzip operation takes `io.automatiko.engine.addons.services.archive.Archive` instance and 
extracts it to a set of `io.automatiko.engine.api.workflow.files.File` instances with type of content of `byte[]` type.

=== Data mapping

When used via service task this service expects following data mapping

* Inputs
** archive - archive to be extracted

* Output
** files - variable where the extracted files should be set 

=== On success
Successful extraction will return list of `io.automatiko.engine.api.workflow.files.File` instances.

=== On failure
Failure during creation of the archive will throw a `io.automatiko.engine.api.workflow.ServiceExecutionError`
with error code `unzipFailure` so it can be used within workflow definition to handle errors 


== Usage

To be able to use this service addon a project must be given following dependency


[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.automatiko.addons.services</groupId>
  <artifactId>automatiko-archive-addon</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

There is no configuration required for this service and thus can be directly used within 
workflow definitions via `Service Task`

Declare service interface

image::declare-interface.png[]

Configure service task interface

image::archive-1.png[]

Configure parameters to invoke (in this case the `zip` operation)

image::archive-2.png[]

In this example, an archive is built with two files (`resume` and `coverLetter`) and named `documents.zip`.
Once successfully built it will be assigned to `documents` variable in the workflow instance.
