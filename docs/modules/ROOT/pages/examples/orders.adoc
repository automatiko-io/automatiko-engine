= Orders

Orders example service demonstrates simple order management solution
that is based on events. All actions taken by a customer are represented
as individual events.

Customer starts with `creating an empty order`, that is like an intent of
placing an order. Orders are uniquely identified e.g. `ORDER-1`.

Based on further searches in the online store, items can be added, removed
or updated in the order.

Finally order is placed and then shipped.

WARNING: Note that this example is currently not equipped with user facing UI

== Run it

The only thing that is needed is Apache Kafka running that will be accessible.
It needs to be given as part of run command via environment variable `KAFKA_SERVERS`

`docker run -e KAFKA_SERVERS=KAFKA_HOST:9092 -p 8080:8080 automatiko/event-streams-orders`

NOTE: To get quickly a running instance of Apache Kafka to run the tests
a spotify kafka container image can be handy, visit
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/spotify/kafka/[Docker Hub] for details

once this is done you can see the fully described service at
 link:http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/#/[]

TIP: You can open your browser link:http://localhost:8080/management/processes/ui[]
to visualize your running service

There are multiple paths that can be taken during given order

=== The happy path

Happy path consists of steps that will lead to successful shipment of gods ordered.

Customer actions are

- creating the order with providing details about him/herself
- adding items
- optionally items can be changed (like change of quantity) or removed completely
- order is placed when the items are selected
- order will calculated, in case of discounts the price will be adjusted
- shipment is created with unique number
- gods are shipped to customer

=== The abandoned path

Abandoned path is taken when customer creates order add items to it but never placed the order.
The service tracks time of every order until it's placed. In this simple scenario
this timeout is set to 10 minutes. That means that customer has 10 minutes to place
the order from the time it was created.

done automatically based on the state or the order.

=== The change address path

Since orders can take a bit before they are shipped, customer can change the address
and thus the order should be made aware of such change.

This operation is done through different topic where all events for a given customer are
being published. Similar to orders, each customer is uniquely identified
by his or her email address.

Orders service will track all active orders for given customer and
whenever customer record is published it will consume it and verify if the change
is relevant to the process. In this example verification is done based
on address of the customer. It will only update the order when address is
different than the one in the order.

NOTE: Regardless how many orders are active for given customer all of them
will be automatically updated
