= MySQL Kubernetes Operator

MySQL Kubernetes Operator example illustrates an operator use case in action. It introduces a custom
resource definition (`MSQLSchema`) that can be used to automatically provision MySQL schemas based on
custom resources.


This example watches a Kubernetes cluster (selected namespaces) custom resources of MySQLSchema kind.
It reacts to change events

- created
- updates
- deleted

At any point in time, when custom resource (of MySQLSchema kind) is modified the operator will be notified
and will perform logic associated with provisioning of the schema with configuration provided as a specification 
of the custom resource.

Depending which change event is received different actions will be invoked.

== Run it

To be able to run it a Kubernetes cluster must be available. It could be local installation, such as 

- Minikube
- Kind

or it can be cloud based Kubernetes cluster like

- Google Kubernetes Engine
- OpenShift
- Azure kubernetes Engine
- others


=== Create custom resource definition for MySQLSchema

Once the Kubernetes cluster is available, let's define our custom resource definition to the Kubernetes Cluster is aware of it.

Download the k8s descriptors from the project source code that can be found link:https://github.com/automatiko-io/automatiko-examples/tree/main/mysql-operator/k8s[`here`].

=== Deploy MySQL data base

Since the operator is responsible for provisioning MySQL schemas then there is a need to have MySQL data base
server where these schemas will be created. For that we simply deploy the MySQL container into the Kubernetes cluster.

`kubectl apply -f k8s/mysql-db.yaml`

          value: password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
----

=== Deploy the operator

Once the custom resource definition is deployed to the cluster, the operator itself can be deployed. 
There are several things that needs to be done to the Kubernetes cluster to make the operator
fully operational.

- Deploy the operator container
- Create service account for the operator
- Create cluster role
- Create cluster role binding


`kubectl apply -f k8s/operator.yaml`

This descriptor contains five objects that will be created in Kubernetes cluster

- a `mysql-schema` namespace
- deployment of the operator container image
- service account
- cluster role that grants the access to the api for MySQLSchema resources to be able to interact with them
- cluter role binding to bind the service account of operator with cluster role

NOTE: A dedicated namespace is created for it so it's easy to keep it isolated and cleaned up
after use.

Depending on the Kubernetes cluster used there might be a need for extra object to be created to expose the
operator web interface to the consumers outside of the Kubernetes cluster. Following is an example for Minikube

First expose the deployment via load balancer

`kubectl expose deployment mysql-schema-operator --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 -n mysql-schema`

And then open the service via minikube

`minikube service  mysql-schema-operator  -n mysql-schema` 



once this is done you can see the fully described service at
 link:http://localhost:PORT/swagger-ui/#/[]

TIP: You can open your browser link:http://localhost:PORT/management/processes/ui[]
to visualize your running service

There are multiple paths that can be taken during the operator processing a given MySQLSchema resource

image:operator-workflow.png[]

=== The happy path

Happy path consists of steps that will lead to successful provisioning of a MySQL schema.

==== Try it

Follow steps in the `Details` section to see the happy path in action.

[%collapsible]
====
Create new MySQLSchema custom resource in `mysql-schema` namespace

`kubectl apply -f k8s/schema.yaml -n mysql-schema`

Here is a content of the file for quick reference

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "mysql.sample.javaoperatorsdk/v1"
kind: MySQLSchema
metadata:
  name: mydb-test
spec:
  encoding: utf8
----


This will directly trigger provisioning actual MySQL schema in the data base. In addition to that
it will also create a secret in the same namespace with name the same as custom resource - `mydb-test`.

At the end it will update the custom resource's status with following information

- status - `CREATED`
- url - url to the provisioned schema
- username - user name to be used to connect to the schema
- secret - name of the secret that holds the password for the schema


At this point the schema is successfully provisioned and ready for use. When no loner needed it can be easily removed
when the custom resource is removed from the cluster.

The operator keeps the workflow instance active as long as the associated custom resource is deployed to the
Kubernetes cluster. You can look at the details of each instance by looking at the process management UI component
exposed by the operator

image:operator-process-mgmt-1.png[]

And look at individual instance details

image:operator-process-mgmt-2.png[]

Lastly you can clean up the custom resource by simply removing it from the cluster

`kubectl delete -f k8s/schema.yaml -n mysql-schema`

This will trigger operator that will remove both db schema and user.

====

=== The error path

The error path consists of steps that lead to a failure when creating the schema and 
but that not provisioning it properly. 

==== Try it

Follow steps in the `Details` section to see the happy archive path in action.

====
Create new MySQLSchema custom resource in `mysql-schema` namespace that has an invalid encoding.

`kubectl apply -f k8s/schema.yaml -n mysql-schema`

Here is a content of the file for quick reference


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "mysql.sample.javaoperatorsdk/v1"
kind: MySQLSchema
metadata:
  name: mydb-test
spec:
  encoding: wrong
----


This will directly trigger provisioning actual MySQL schema in the data base which will fail as there 
is no such encoding as `wrong`. It will handle error and take an alternative path to update custom 
resource in the cluster with an error message. You can look at the status of the resource

`kubectl describe mysqlschemas.mysql.sample.javaoperatorsdk/mydb-test -n mysql-schema`

This will show a error message being set as a status

[source,yaml]
----
...
Spec:
  Encoding:  wrong
Status:
  Secret Name:  <nil>
  Status:       schema creation failure
  URL:          <nil>
  User Name:    <nil>
Events:         <none>
----

Correct the encoding in `k8s/schema.yaml` and apply it again

`kubectl apply -f k8s/schema.yaml -n mysql-schema`

This time the updated event is processed by the operator and the schema is provisioned successfully, including creation
of the secret with password to the schema. You can view secrets with following command.

`kubectl get secret -n mysql-schema`

Lastly you can clean up the custom resource by simply removing it from the cluster

`kubectl delete -f k8s/schema.yaml -n mysql-schema`

This will trigger operator that will remove both db schema and user.
