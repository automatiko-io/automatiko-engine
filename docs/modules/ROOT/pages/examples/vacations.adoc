= Vacation requests

Vacation requests example illustrates the human centric use case combined with
data base records use case. Vacation requests are placed by individual employees
and are automatically tracked as complete set of requests.
This enables clear visibility from employee point of view to see all his/her
requests regardless of their status. It also keeps track of how many days are used
and still eligible for further use.

At he same time, vacation requests require approval by manager and thus
a tasks are assigned to employee's manager on each newly submitted vacation request.

Employee has an option to cancel request as long as the date when the vacation
should start has not been reached yet.

This service also allows to onboard new employees by assigning eligible vacation
days and a manager based on department employee is in.

As part of onboarding
following will take place directly:

- calculate eligible vacation days
- assign manager

Above data is derived from decision tables that look as follows

.Assign manager
|===
|Manager |Department

|john@email.com
|finance

|mary@email.com
|it

|joe@email.com
|hr

|===

.Vacation days eligibility
|===
|Year of start |Number of days

|< 2000
|25

|< 2010
|20

|< 2015
|18

|< 2015
|10

WARNING: Note that this example is currently not equipped with user facing UI

== Run it

This example is self container for simplicity meaning it uses H2 data base
so there is no need for additional components to run this example.

`docker run -p 8080:8080 automatiko/vacation-requests`

Alternatively there is also a option to run this service with email notifications enabled. This requires
some extra environment variables to be set when starting the container

`docker run -p 8080:8080 -e QUARKUS_PROFILE=withemail -e EMAIL_TO=TO -e EMAIL_FROM=FROM  -e EMAIL_HOST=HOST -e EMAIL_PORT=PORT -e EMAIL_USER=USER -e EMAIL_PASSWORD=PASSWORD automatiko/vacation-requests`

You need to set following environment variables with proper email server data

.Environment variables for email notifications
|===
|Name |Value | Example

|EMAIL_TO
|email address where all notifications should be sent to
|user@gmail.com

|EMAIL_FROM
|email address the the emails are sent from
|user@gmail.com

|EMAIL_HOST
|host name of SMTP server
|smtp.gmail.com

|EMAIL_PORT
|port number of SMTP server
|587

|EMAIL_USER
|username to be used to authenticate on SMTP server
|user@gmail.com

|EMAIL_PASSWORD
|password to be used to authenticate on SMTP server
|secret_password

|===

With above configuration email notifications for user tasks are going to be sent out. Using default template 
for email addresses that will look like this

image::examples-vacation-request-form-email.png[]


once this is done you can see the fully described service at
 link:http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/#/[]

TIP: You can open your browser link:http://localhost:8080/management/processes/ui[]
to visualize your running service

There are multiple paths that can be taken during given order

First top level (public) workflow defines the onboarding and overall tracking
for every employee - every instance is identified as employee's email

image::vacations-workflow.png[]

Second workflow is responsible for managing individual requests for a given
employee, from the submission to either cancelation or its start date.

=== Authorization

This service is fully secured and requires authentication to be able to interact
with it. Below table represents available users in the service

.Users available
|===
|User name |Password |Roles

|john@email.com
|john
|employee

|mary@email.com
|mary
|employee

|mark@email.com
|mark
|employee

|joe@email.com
|joe
|employee

|admin@email.com
|admin
|admin

|===

NOTE: There is also instance level security that is based on `participants` access
policy. This means that given instance will be visible to the owner of it
(the employee) and the assignees of currently active user tasks - for example
manager who has at least one approval task awaiting.

TIP: Note that there is simple UI for manager to see incoming approval tasks.
Just open browser at link:http://localhost:8080[] and connect using `john@email.com`. You can also use this
UI for employees to see the cancelation of vacation requests, connect using `mary@email.com` to receive 
tasks assigned to mary as employee.


=== The happy path

Happy path consists of steps that will onboard the employee and submit single
vacation request that is approved and is not cancelled by the employee.

==== Try it

Follow steps in the `Details` section to see the happy path in action.

[%collapsible]
====
Here are the steps to try out with happy path

* Onboard employee

- Http Method: `POST`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/vacations`
- Payload
[json]
----
{
  "employee": {
    "email": "mary@email.com",
    "firstName": "Mary",
    "lastName": "Jane",
    "startedAt": "2000-12-01",
    "department": "finance"
  }
}
----

complete curl command for this request is as follows

[source,plain]
----
curl -u mary@email.com:mary -X POST "http://localhost:8080/vacations" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"employee\":{\"email\":\"mary@email.com\",\"firstName\":\"Mary\",\"lastName\":\"Jane\",\"startedAt\":\"2020-12-26\",\"department\":\"finance\"}}"
----

This will create new instance identified as `mary@email.com`.

* Submit a vacation request

- Http Method: `POST`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/vacations/mary@email.com/submit`
- Payload
[json]
----
{
  "from": "2020-10-01",
  "length": 15,
  "to": "2020-10-15",
  "key": "vacation"
}
----

complete curl command for this request is as follows

[source,plain]
----
curl -u mary@email.com:mary -X POST "http://localhost:8080/vacations/mary%40email.com/submit" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"from\":\"2020-10-01\",\"length\":15,\"to\":\"2020-10-15\",\"key\":\"vacation\"}"
----

* Fetch approval tasks as manager

- Http Method: `GET`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/vacations/mary@email.com/request/vacation/tasks`


complete curl command for this request is as follows

[source,plain]
----
curl -u john@email.com:john -X GET "http://localhost:8080/vacations/mary%40email.com/requests/vacation/tasks" -H  "accept: application/json"
----

NOTE: Make note of the id returned from the above request as it will be used to complete
the approval task


* Approve vacation request

- Http Method: `POST`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/vacations/mary@email.com/requests/vacation/approval/ID`
- Payload
[json]
----
{
  "approved": true
}
----

IMPORTANT: Replace the `\{ID}` at the end of endpoint with ID from the previous call.
Same is required in the below curl command.

There is also option to look at the UI based form to work on the approval task. When getting task list for manager
there are formLink returned that can be easily used to open a form in a browser window. Just prepend the host name
of the service before the form link and open in the browser which should look like this

image::examples-vacation-request-form-approval.png[]

complete curl command for this request is as follows

[source,plain]
----
curl -u john@email.com:john -X POST "http://localhost:8080/vacations/mary@email.com/requests/vacation/approval/ID" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"approved\":true}"
----

Now the workflow instance will wait until the first day of vacation request or
until it is cancelled by the employee.

* Verify access policy restricting access to instances

Each employee has his/her instance completely secured. That means only that
employee can see it or manager - when it has approval task assigned. To verify
this working try to access mary's instance by joe.


- Http Method: `GET`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/vacations/mary@email.com`


complete curl command for this request is as follows

[source,plain]
----
curl -u joe@email.com:joe -X GET "http://localhost:8080/vacations/mary%40email.com" -H  "accept: application/json"
----


* Clean the state

This is completely for test purpose to allow to use same data for other paths

- Http Method: `DELETE`
- Endpoint: `http://localhost:8080/vacations/mary@email.com`


complete curl command for this request is as follows

[source,plain]
----
curl -u mary@email.com:mary -X DELETE "http://localhost:8080/vacations/mary%40email.com" -H  "accept: application/json"
----

=== The rejection path

Rejection path consists of steps that will onboard the employee and submit single
vacation request that is rejected by manager.
