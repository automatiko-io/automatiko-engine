= Water Leak detection

Water leak detection example service demonstrates simple anomalies detection
such as water leaks based on collected sensor data.

Buildings are equipped with various sensors such as water meters, humidity
and more. In this example each room in the building will report its
water consumption on regular intervals - every 2 minutes. In addition to that
each room will also report humidity level, again on time intervals - every 10 minutes.

Based on this data, service will perform calculation of

- min value
- max value
- average value

Knowing these values anomalies can be detected by applying rules defined.

- Humidity higher than 80% can be considered as anomaly or even potential water
leak
- water consumption within 5 consequent measurements that is higher than 100
is considered leak.

In any of the above cases technicians would be called to investigate the
situation in the actual building.

== Run it

The only thing that is needed is Apache Kafka running that will be accessible.
It needs to be given as part of run command via environment variable `KAFKA_SERVERS`

`docker run -e MQTT_SERVER= -e MQTT_PORT= -p 8080:8080 automatiko/event-streams-sensors`

NOTE: To get quickly a running instance of Mosquitto to run the tests visit
link:https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto[Docker Hub] for details

once this is done you can see the fully described service at

An important detail to mention is that MQTT allows to subscribe using wild cards.
This feature is used in this example as it allows flexible workflow definition.

Both start events (`Water measurement` and `Humidity measurement`) subscribe to
MQTT topics using wild cards

- `building/+/+/water` - this allows to receive any building's and any room
of that building water consumption data
- `building/+/+/humidity` - this allows to receive any building's and any room
of that building humidity data

In reality this means that every incoming sensor data to topic that matches this
MQTT wildcard will either start new instance of the workflow or push data into
already existing one.

*Example*

Humidity sensor in room 555 in building ABC will push data to `building/ABC/555/humidity`
topic and humidity sensor in the same building but room 123 will push data to
`building/ABC/555/humidity` topic.

This in turn will create two workflow (`waterleasks`)
instances that will be uniquely identified (so called business key)
`ABC-555` and `ABC-123` respectively.

NOTE: This business key (`ABC-555`) can be used at any time to get hold of
given workflow instance with service API. It is also configurable when it
come to the format and content of the business key - in this example it
retrieves information from the actual topic data was sent to.

Similar water consumption data are handled. If they match the same building and
room the data will be "appended" to already existing workflow instance, otherwise
new instance will be started.

There are multiple paths that can be taken during detection process

image::water-leaks-workflow.png[]

Each incoming sensor data will trigger either

- `Water measurement` in case it comes from water meter
- `Humidity measurement` in case it comes from humidity sensor

Water measurements are collected into a bucket that allows to accumulate
values and perform calculation on top of items.

Humidity data is constantly replacing previous value (if there was any),
so it always represents last known value.

=== The happy path

The happy path for humidity means humidity level below 85%.
The happy path for water measurement means that there won't be max value
greater than 100.

NOTE: Water measurements are calculated every fifth value being received.

==== Try it

Follow steps in the `Details` section to see the happy path in action.

Here are the steps to try out with happy path

* Publish room 100 of building Main humidity data

- Topic `building/Main/100/humidity`
- Payload
[json]
----
{
  "ts" : 1608570416309,
  "val" : 48.0
}
----

* Publish room 100 of building Main water data

- Topic `building/Main/100/water`
- Payload
[json]
----
{
  "ts" : 1608570416309,
  "val" : 25.0
}
----

Repeat water consumption data more than 5 times to see the report being
calculated. At any point in time you can use service API to see current
state of the active instances.

NOTE: Why the format of the payload is as it is? The main reason is that it
follows link:https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome/mqtt-smarthome[MQTT SmartHome]
 specification to provide some degree of standardisation.

====

=== The leak detected path

The leak detected path means water measurement won't be at any time
greater than 100. This is based on report - calculated values of
at least 5 data points - measurements.

As soon as there will be a value exceeding 100 for water consumption level it will
 trigger a task assigned to technicians. That means that there is a need for
 investigation on site to confirm or deny detected anomaly.

NOTE: Water measurements are calculated every fifth value being received.

* Publish room 100 of building Main water data

- Topic `building/Main/100/water`

[json]
----
{
 "ts" : 1608570416309,

}

Repeat water consumption data more than 5 times to see the report being
calculated and task assigned to technicians.

At any point in time you can use service API to see current
state of the active instances. For instance to get currently assigned
tasks for technicians for room 100 in building ABC issue following request

`http://localhost:8080/waterleaks/Main-100/tasks?group=technicians`

=== The humidity level too high path

The humidity level too high path means that at any time when humidity level is grater
than 85 it will assign another task for technicians. It is rather probable that there is
some kind of anomaly when humidity is too high.

[json]

This will create workflow instance and directly assign task for technicians.

At any point in time you can use service API to see current
state of the active instances. For instance to get currently assigned
tasks for technicians for room 100 in building ABC issue following request

`http://localhost:8080/waterleaks/Main-100/tasks?group=technicians`

=== The publish report path

Sensor data are collected for given amount of time. In this example they are set
to 1 hour. After one hour from first data received for given room and a building
report will be published to another MQTT topic.

The reports topic will be calculated based on the building and room it collects
data for. For example, workflow instance identified as (`ABC-123` which means
it collects data for room 123 in building ABC) will publish its report to
MQTT topic `reports/ABC/123/hourly`.

TIP: In case you don't want to wait for an hour to see the report being published
you can start the docker image with extra environment variable `-e WATER_LEAKS_TIMER=PT5M`
this will publish report after 5 minutes instead of 1 hour.

Another interesting aspect is that when report is published it will be consumed
but another workflow that is responsible for collecting data for entire building
based on published reports.
