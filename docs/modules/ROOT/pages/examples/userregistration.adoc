= User registration

User registration example illustrates `Workflow as a Function Flow` concept that breaks down a workflow
definition into functions and automatically invokes them by emitting events (in cloud event format). 

This example takes a simple user registration use case and implements it as workflow. The logic behind is
composed of

- validating provided user information
- generating username and password
- verifying that given user name is not yet registered in the Swagger PetStore service
- creating user in the Swagger PetStore service

So the workflow defines multiple types of operations that are being invoked, starting from java services
implemented within the service and finishing at REST invocation based on OpenAPI definitions.

In addition to that REST calls are equipped with error handling to tackle unexpected responses like server
errors during creation of a user in Swagger PetStore service or expected situations like user not found in Swagger 
PetStore service.

== Run it

There are multiple paths that can be taken during the user registration

image:user-registration-workflow.png[]

Here is the functions that are broken out of the workflow

image:user-registration-workflow-functions.png[]

A surprising might be that the `Notify invalid data` is not selected as a function. The reason is that
the `Notify invalid data` is combined with `Verify user data` into single function to show case ability 
of being able to control which activities are included in single function.

To be able to run it a Kubernetes cluster must be available with KNative Eventing installed. It could be local installation, such as 

- Minikube
- Kind

or it can be cloud based Kubernetes cluster like

- Google Kubernetes Engine
- OpenShift
- Azure kubernetes Engine
- others

To install KNative, look at link:https://knative.dev/docs/install[official documentation] 

Once the Knative and Kubernates cluster is available you can deploy the example by invoking following commands

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f k8s/user-registration.yaml

Optionally you can also deploy event displayer to see all events flowing through the Knative broker

[source,yaml]
----
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: event-display
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels: &labels
      app: event-display

      labels: *labels
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: event-display
          image: gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing/cmd/event_display

---

kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: event-display
spec:
  selector:
    app: event-display
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
EOF
----

Deploy the trigger for event displayer that will simply consume all events as there is no filter defined

[source,yaml]
----
kubectl apply -f - << EOF
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: event-display

     name: event-display
EOF

----

Get the url of the default broker use following command

[source,plain]
----
kubectl get broker default
----

which should produce similar output

[source,plain]
----

=== The happy path

Happy path consists of steps that will lead to successful user registration.

==== Try it

Follow steps in the `Details` section to see the happy path in action.

[%collapsible]
====

NOTE: Login to a curler pod that enables an easy access to the broker to send requests as it might not be exposed to 
external traffic (e.g. ingress). If your Knative broker is exposed to external traffic you can skip the curler step.

Issue following curl command from the pod running within cluster so the broker url will be properly resolved.

[source,plain]
----
curl -v "http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/knativetutorial/default" \
-X POST \
-H "Ce-Id: 1234" \
-H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
-H "Ce-Type: io.automatiko.examples.userRegistration" \
-H "Ce-Source: curl" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"user" : {"email" : "mike.strong@email.com",  "firstName" : "mike",  "lastName" : "strong"}}'
----

This will send a request to the broker using HTTP binary binding for cloud events. The cloud events information
are given http headers prefixed with `ce-`. 

Taking into consideration that this request was sent for the first time it should register user in Swagger PetStore.

NOTE: It might result in a already registered when the user was already registered so consider updating the first name 
and last name in the request payload with custom data that will ensure new user

====


=== The invalid data path

Invalid data path consists of steps that will lead to fast finish without user registration.

==== Try it

Follow steps in the `Details` section to see the invalid data path in action.

[%collapsible]
====

NOTE: Login to a curler pod that enables an easy access to the broker to send requests as it might not be exposed to 
external traffic (e.g. ingress). If your Knative broker is exposed to external traffic you can skip the curler step.

-H "Ce-Id: 1234" \
-H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
-H "Ce-Type: io.automatiko.examples.userRegistration" \
-H "Ce-Source: curl" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"user" : {"email" : "mike.strong@email.com",  "firstName" : "mike",  "lastName" : ""}}'
----

This will send a request to the broker using HTTP binary binding for cloud events. The cloud events information
are given http headers prefixed with `ce-`. 

Since user's last name is not set the workflow will reject processing due to invalid data

====


=== The already registered path

Already registered path consists of steps that will lead to fast finish without user registration.

==== Try it

Follow steps in the `Details` section to see the already registered path in action.

[%collapsible]
====

NOTE: Login to a curler pod that enables an easy access to the broker to send requests as it might not be exposed to 
external traffic (e.g. ingress). If your Knative broker is exposed to external traffic you can skip the curler step.

Issue following curl command from the pod running within cluster so the broker url will be properly resolved.
Main rule here is that there should be already user with same first and last name registered. For example 
that the happy path has been executed.

[source,plain]
----
curl -v "http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/knativetutorial/default" \
-X POST \
-H "Ce-Id: 1234" \
-H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
-H "Ce-Type: io.automatiko.examples.userRegistration" \
-H "Ce-Source: curl" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"user" : {"email" : "mike.strong@email.com",  "firstName" : "mike",  "lastName" : "strong"}}'
----

This will send a request to the broker using HTTP binary binding for cloud events. The cloud events information
are given http headers prefixed with `ce-`. 

Since user was already registered processing is stopped
