= Document processor

Document processor example illustrates `batch processing` use case that processes documents as either
individual files or archives as soon as they are dropped into the inbox folder.

image:examples-batch.png[]

WARNING: Note that this example is currently not equipped with user facing UI

This example watches a folder (an inbox) for files to be processed, it supports:

- text files - those with extension `.txt`
- archive files - those with extension `.zip`

Archive files are expected to contain `.txt` files only.

Depending which file type is dropped into directory different workflow will be triggered.

Text files are also classified and based on classification different paths are invoked:

- greetings (text files that starts with `hello`)
- reports (text files with length more than 100)
- confidential (text files that have the file name `password.txt`)
- unclassified (all other text files)

Zip file can contain any classification types.

== Run it

To run the example as container there is a need to mount a local folder as volume to
be able to easily drop files for processing. To do so, replace `LOCAL_DIRECTORY`
with an absolute folder path of your local file system.

`docker run -e DOCUMENTS_FOLDER=/automatiko/documents -v LOCAL_DIRECTORY:/automatiko/documents -p 8080:8080 automatiko/document-processor`

once this is done you can see the fully described service at

TIP: You can open your browser link:http://localhost:8080/management/processes/ui[]
to visualize your running service

There are multiple paths that can be taken during given order

Process individual text files

Process archives and delegates to individual file processing for every item found in the archive

=== The happy path

Happy path consists of steps that will lead to successful processing single text file.

==== Try it

Follow steps in the `Details` section to see the happy path in action.

[%collapsible]
====
Create a text file named `say-hello.txt` (it can actually be named anything just
need to have `.txt` extension)

The content of the file should contain word `hello` and it can contain any other text.

NOTE: Keep it short (less than 100 characters) as if this exceed 100 it will be
considered as report.

Copy this file into `LOCAL_DIRECTORY` folder that was mapped to the container.

Observe both `LOCAL_DIRECTORY` and container logs to see that file was processed.
====

=== The happy archive path

Happy path consists of steps that will lead to successful processing all text
files found in the archive (`zip`).

==== Try it

Follow steps in the `Details` section to see the happy archive path in action.

[%collapsible]
====
Create a text file named `say-hello.txt` (it can actually be named anything just
need to have `.txt` extension)

The content of the file should contain word `hello` and it can contain any other text.

NOTE: Keep it short (less than 100 characters) as if this exceed 100 it will be
considered as report.

Create another `.txt` let's say `say-another-hello.txt` with again content
that has `hello` word.

Zip both files into `archive.zip` and copy this file into `LOCAL_DIRECTORY`
folder that was mapped to the container.

Observe both `LOCAL_DIRECTORY` and container logs to see that archive
file was processed and each file of the archive as well.

====

=== The report path

Happy path consists of steps that will lead to successful processing
of a report file and approval of it's content.

==== Try it

Follow steps in the `Details` section to see the happy path in action.

[%collapsible]
====
Create a text file named `report.txt` (it can actually be named anything just
need to have `.txt` extension)

The content of the file can be anything and it must be longer than 100 characters.
