= User tasks

User assigned tasks are rather common in workflow based systems. They usually represent some need of either doing
manual work by human actors or there is a need to collect some data from users. In anyway there is often the need
to present this is human readable way (user interface) and to make sure people are aware of the tasks is to notify
them.

Automatiko comes with following addons that help with user tasks within workflows

* automatiko-user-tasks-management-addon
* automatiko-user-tasks-email-addon
* automatiko-user-tasks-slack-addon
* automatiko-user-tasks-teams-addon

== User tasks management

User task management addon brings basic support for displaying user focused information about tasks assigned 
to human actors. That is usually in form format where users can provide input required to continue with 
the workflow instance. 

NOTE: Automatiko does not aim at providing you with auto generated forms as this is usually more complex than 
automatic generation can handle. For instance layout of the form might be really complex, data that the form 
displays can come from various places and not all of them are kept in workflow instance etc.

Forms are based on templates that are suppose to be given as part of your service where Automatiko can locate them
and present to the user when requested. All will be rendered as fully featured website so it can be easily embedded
 in custom websites for integration purpose.
 
Templates are based on link:https://quarkus.io/guides/qute[Qute templating engine].
 
Developers can build their templates for each task to ensure that proper readability of the work to be done is given
to users who get tasks assigned. Template files should be located in `src/main/resources/templates` folder of your
service project. Files are expected to have following extensions

* `.html`
* `.txt`

It is recommended to use `html` as it is closer to the actual content of it.

Naming convention of the template files is as follows

* task name property defined on the user task
* name of the user task
* workflow identifier with task name property defined on the user task
* workflow identifier with name of the user task

For example when you have a task named `My Task` that has task name property `approval` within workflow with id 'vacations'
 then you can create following template files that will be found

* `approval.html`
* `vacations.approval.html`
* `My Task.html`
* `vacations.My Task.html`

TIP: Recommended it to use simple names that are defined as `TaskName` property of the user task as template name as it 
is also used as part of service api (REST api) so it will be easier to correlate these two.

Since these files are considered to be templates there are several variables given that will represent various data 
of the user task assigned.

|===
|Name| Description

|task | task instance in simplified format giving access to task name, description workflow metadata etc
|link | link to the endpoint to work on a user task instance, allows to push data and complete it
|inputs | input data of the user task
|results | results data of the user task - this will be populated with inputs if the match by name and do not have value set

|===

NOTE: When there is no template file found for given task a default form will be returned but it will only 
provide simple text based form inputs. It is recommended to always provide custom templates for user tasks.

==== External templates loaded at runtime

Not always templates can be provided at build time, for instance when the existing ones should be customized.
To be able to allow customization templates can be loaded at runtime based on folder path given by 
`quarkus.automatiko.templates-folder` configuration property. 

All files with `.html` extension will be loaded and registered to the templating engine and by that can 
be used by user task forms and emails. 


=== Configure

To enable user tasks management addon add following dependency to your service

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.automatiko.addons</groupId>
  <artifactId>automatiko-user-tasks-management-addon</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Start process forms

As part of user task management addon, forms to start instances can also be provided. It works in exactly the same way as user tasks forms 
- based on template files. Templates must be named in following way:

- `{processid}.html` where `processid` is the identifier used for process definition
- `{processid}_{version}.html` where `processid` is the identifier used for process definition and `version` of the process definition if version is used
- `org/acme/test/{processid}.html` where `org/acme/test` is the package name used for process definition transformed to a path (`org.acme.test`)

TIP: Using package names allows to have better structure of template files in case of any workflows exist in given project.

Templates can reference following parameters to provide more tailored forms

|===
|Name| Description

|id | unique identifier of the process definition
|name | name of the process definition
|description | optional description of the process definition
|version | version of the process definition
|url | url where the data should be send (posted) to start new instance

|===

When the addon is used and form template is not defined for given workflow then a default form is returned. Default forms are 
for information only and do not allow to submit. Users can change the default templates providing template files with following
names:

- `workflow-not-found.html` - to provide a form when no dedicate template for workflow exists
- `workflow-not-authorized.html` - to provide a form when user is not authorized to create instances of given workflow

Same parameters are available to default templates as described above, with one exception that `url` is not given for not authorized 
form.

== User tasks email notifications

Human actors usually prefer to receive notifications when there is an awaiting task assigned to them. This is where
email notifications come handy. Similar to forms, email notifications are template based but here relying on defaults
might be actually a good thing. 

Here is a sample email with default template for user task

image::email-notification.png[]

Them main purpose for the notification is to give a hint there is something and provide base set of information. 

Naming convention of the template files is as follows

* task name property defined on the user task with suffix `-email.html`
* name of the user task with suffix `-email.html`
* workflow identifier with task name property defined on the user task with suffix `-email.html`
* workflow identifier with name of the user task with suffix `-email.html`

For example when you have a task named `My Task` that has task name property `approval` within workflow with id 'vacations'
 then you can create following template files that will be found

* `approval-email.html`
* `vacations.approval-email.html`
* `My Task-email.html`
* `vacations.My Task-email.html`

There might be some special cases where extra information should be included but by default notifications via email
aim at not exposing too much of the task context like input information.

Note that in case of multiple users are assigned to the task or assignment is based on group, all of these will receive an email
It will be sent with dedicated link to the form so access to the task is really simple.

Since these files are considered to be templates there are several variables given that will represent various data 
of the user task assigned.

|===
|Name| Description

|name | name of the user task
|description | description of the user task (can be null or empty)
|taskId | unique identifier of the task instance
|instanceId | unique identifier of the workflow instance task belongs to
|processId | identifier of the workflow definition user task belongs to
|processName | name of the workflow definition user task belongs to
|inputs | current data set for the user task - in form of a Map
|link | direct and absolute link to the form for user task

|===

=== Customize email subject for notifications

Email subject that is sent for user task notifications is by default a fixed name 
with following value:

`New task has been assigned to you (NAME OF THE TASK)`

That's not always desired and more tailored email subject is required. 
This can be achieved on each user task level by setting the 
`EmailSubject` data input to the value that should be used for 
actual notification email subject.

NOTE: The email subject can also be generated based on data object via expressions.


[source,plain]
----
quarkus.mailer.auth-methods=DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-SHA256 CRAM-SHA1 CRAM-MD5 PLAIN LOGIN
quarkus.mailer.from=YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com
quarkus.mailer.host=smtp.gmail.com
quarkus.mailer.port=587
quarkus.mailer.start-tls=REQUIRED
quarkus.mailer.username=YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com
quarkus.mailer.password=PASSWORD
----

In addition, service url must also be defined as it is used to construct the absolute url of the form sent out 
via email.

[source,plain]
----
quarkus.automatiko.serviceUrl=https://myservice.hostname.com
----

IMPORTANT: When you run your service in development mode or test mode email are not being sent out so you can easily 
work on them without spamming too much. You can also use mock inbox to validate emails being sent out in your tests.

Email is sent only to valid email addresses so when your user ids are not represented as email address then you need
to provide custom implementation of `io.automatiko.engine.addons.usertasks.email.EmailAddressResolver` interface that
is responsible for resolving user and groups to their email addresses.
You can also use that interface to suppress sending emails for certain users and/or groups.

== User tasks slack notifications

Similar to email notifications, slack messages can also be used as notifications for user tasks. Slack integration is based on 
link:https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=slack+incoming+webhook&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8[incoming webhooks feature in Slack] and allows to send messages to given channel.

To be able to use slack integration, the channel (as name) needs to be specified on user task via custom attributes. The custom attribute 
is called `slack-channel`

The content of the message that will be posted to the Slack channel can be made user task specific as it is based on templates.

Naming convention of the template files is as follows

* task name property defined on the user task with suffix `-slack.txt`
* name of the user task with suffix `-slack.txt`
* workflow identifier with task name property defined on the user task with suffix `-slack.txt`
* workflow identifier with name of the user task with suffix `-slack.txt`

For example when you have a task named `My Task` that has task name property `approval` within workflow with id 'vacations'
 then you can create following template files that will be found

* `approval-slack.txt`
* `vacations.approval-slack.txt`
* `My Task-slack.txt`
* `vacations.My Task-slack.txt`

There might be some special cases where extra information should be included but by default notifications via slack
aim at not exposing too much of the task context like input information.

Since these files are considered to be templates there are several variables given that will represent various data 
of the user task assigned.

|===
|Name| Description

|name | name of the user task
|description | description of the user task (can be null or empty)
|taskId | unique identifier of the task instance
|instanceId | unique identifier of the workflow instance task belongs to
|processId | identifier of the workflow definition user task belongs to
|processName | name of the workflow definition user task belongs to
|inputs | current data set for the user task - in form of a Map
|link | direct and absolute link to the form for user task

|===

IMPORTANT: Since the template for Slack is JSON based, the regular parts of the JSON structure `{` and `}` must be escaped in the template with `\{` and `\}`.

.Example of Slack template
[source,plain]
----
\{
	"blocks": [
		\{
			"type": "section",
			"text": \{
				"type": "mrkdwn",
				"text": "Process '{processName}' requires user action on instance {instanceId}"
			\}
		\},
		\{
			"type": "section",
			"text": \{
				"type": "mrkdwn",
				"text": "A new task ({name}) has been assigned\n\n<{link}|View task details>"
			\}
		\}
	]
\}
----


=== Configure

To enable user tasks slack addon add following dependency to your service

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.automatiko.addons</groupId>
  <artifactId>automatiko-user-tasks-slack-addon</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In addition to that there must be configuration of your slack channels webhook urls. Usually this is set in
`application.properties` of your service but can also be given as system properties or environment variables

[source,plain]
----
quarkus.automatiko.notifications.slack.test=https://hooks.slack.com......
quarkus.automatiko.notifications.slack.another=https://hooks.slack.com......
quarkus.automatiko.notifications.slack.onemore=https://hooks.slack.com......
----

NOTE: There can be many channels defined and the names of the channels in `application.properties` file (e.g. `test`, `another`) are those that should be
referenced in the user task custom attributes via `slack-channel`. This provides an abstraction layer on top of real channel names

== User tasks teams notifications

Similar to slack notifications, Microsoft Teams messages can also be used as notifications for user tasks. Teams integration is based on 
link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet[incoming webhooks feature in MS Teams] and allows to send messages to given channel.

To be able to use teams integration, the channel (as name) needs to be specified on user task via custom attributes. The custom attribute 
is called `teams-channel`

The content of the message that will be posted to the Teams channel can be made user task specific as it is based on templates.

Naming convention of the template files is as follows

* task name property defined on the user task with suffix `-teams.txt`
* name of the user task with suffix `-teams.txt`
* workflow identifier with task name property defined on the user task with suffix `-teams.txt`
* workflow identifier with name of the user task with suffix `-teams.txt`

For example when you have a task named `My Task` that has task name property `approval` within workflow with id 'vacations'
 then you can create following template files that will be found

* `approval-teams.txt`
* `vacations.approval-teams.txt`
* `My Task-teams.txt`
* `vacations.My Task-teams.txt`

There might be some special cases where extra information should be included but by default notifications via teams
aim at not exposing too much of the task context like input information.

Since these files are considered to be templates there are several variables given that will represent various data 
of the user task assigned.

|===
|Name| Description

|name | name of the user task
|description | description of the user task (can be null or empty)
|taskId | unique identifier of the task instance
|instanceId | unique identifier of the workflow instance task belongs to
|processId | identifier of the workflow definition user task belongs to
|processName | name of the workflow definition user task belongs to
|inputs | current data set for the user task - in form of a Map
|link | direct and absolute link to the form for user task

|===

IMPORTANT: Since the template for MS Teams is JSON based, the regular parts of the JSON structure `{` and `}` must be escaped in the template with `\{` and `\}`.

.Example of MS Teams template
[source,plain]
----
\{
  "@type": "MessageCard",
  "@context": "http://schema.org/extensions",
  "themeColor": "0076D7",
  "summary": "Task assigned - {name}",
  "sections": [
    \{
      "activityTitle": "Task assigned - {name}",
      "activitySubtitle": "{description}",
      "markdown": true
    \}
  ],
  "potentialAction": [    
    \{
      "@type": "OpenUri",
      "name": "View task details",
      "targets": [
        \{
          "os": "default",
          "uri": "{link}"
        \}
      ]
    \}
  ]
\}
----


=== Configure

To enable user tasks teams addon add following dependency to your service

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.automatiko.addons</groupId>
  <artifactId>automatiko-user-tasks-teams-addon</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

In addition to that there must be configuration of your teams channels webhook urls. Usually this is set in
`application.properties` of your service but can also be given as system properties or environment variables

[source,plain]
----
quarkus.automatiko.notifications.teams.test=https://mycompany.webhook.office.com/webhook......
quarkus.automatiko.notifications.teams.another=https://mycompany.webhook.office.com/webhook......
quarkus.automatiko.notifications.teams.onemore=https://mycompany.webhook.office.com/webhook......
----

NOTE: There can be many channels defined and the names of the channels in `application.properties` file (e.g. `test`, `another`) are those that should be
referenced in the user task custom attributes via `teams-channel`. This provides an abstraction layer on top of real channel names

== Customize templates

In cases where (email, slack, teams) templates have to customized at runtime they can be provided via application 
property that points to a folder where `*.html` or `*.txt` files will be loaded at startup and registered.

It can be given as environment variable `QUARKUS_AUTOMATIKO_TEMPLATES_FOLDER=/templates` or system property 
`-Dquarkus.automatiko.templates.folder=/templates`

Naming convention is the same as for creating templates as part of the source code.

== Custom notification

Users can build custom notifications by implementing a `io.automatiko.engine.addons.usertasks.notification.NotificationEmitter` interface.

This interface is located in `io.automatiko.addons:automatiko-user-tasks-notification`

The implementation must be a CDI bean so it can be discovered and registered automatically.
