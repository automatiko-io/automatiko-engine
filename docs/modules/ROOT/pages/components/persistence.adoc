= Persistence

Automatiko by default runs without any persistent storage so it can be used
without additional components. Though in many cases workflow instances are
long lived and thus require storage to persist its state.

Automatiko comes with several options to chose from

- *File system* based storage
- *Database* based storage
- *Amazon DynamoDB* based storage
- *Apache Cassandra* based storage
- *MongoDB* based storage

NOTE: More is on their way and as soon as they will be implemented they will
be listed here.

== File system based storage

The most basic but quite powerful storage option is based on file system.
This means each workflow instance will be stored in dedicated file in
configured directory.

In addition to file itself, Automatiko will store some metadata that allows
to more efficiently look up instances without loading it completely.

Depending on file system capabilities these metadata will be stored as

- extended file attributes if file system supports it
- `dot file` next to the actual file as a fallback option when file system does
not support extended attributes

=== Configuration

To use file system based perssitence your service must have following dependency

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.automatiko.addons</groupId>
  <artifactId>automatiko-filesystem-persistence-addon</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

NOTE: Note that each persistence addon comes with job service implementation as well
to provide persistence of timers defined in workflows

Additional configuration should be placed in `application.properties`

|====
|Property name|Environment variable|Description|Required|Default value|BuildTime only

|quarkus.automatiko.persistence.type||Specify what persistence should be used|No||Yes
|quarkus.automatiko.persistence.filesystem.path|QUARKUS_AUTOMATIKO_PERSISTENCE_FILESYSTEM_PATH|Location on file system that will be used to store persistent state|Yes||No
||||||
|quarkus.automatiko.jobs.type||Specifies type of jobs implementation to be used|No||Yes
||||||
|quarkus.automatiko.jobs.filesystem.path|QUARKUS_AUTOMATIKO_JOBS_FILESYSTEM_PATH|Location on file system where jobs persistent state will be stored|Yes||No
|quarkus.automatiko.jobs.filesystem.threads|QUARKUS_AUTOMATIKO_JOBS_FILESYSTEM_THREADS|Specifies how many threads should be used for jobs execution|No|1|No

|====

NOTE: This storage option can be used for pretty much any use case but it has certain drawbacks
depending on the file system being used. It might not be the best option when
horizontal scalability is important.

== Database based storage

Database based storage is mainly dedicated to cover `Database record processing`
as it requires workflow data objects to be

- simple types
- entities
- collection of entities

Its main applicability is to store workflow state next to the data it is
processing.

IMPORTANT: Data model of the workflow becomes an entity as well, which on
database level will be represented as table.

Every workflow definition will be stored in dedicated table that is constructed
based on workflow identifier and version. The table will also have all simple
type data objects in the same table and reference any entity data objects.

image:db-persistence-model.png[]

Green tables are those defined as data objects and annotated as entities.
Orange tables are generated based on workflow definitions

- vacations is the top level (public) process for handling vacation requests
- requests is the sub workflow (private) that handles individual request

Blue table is used by jobs service that stores its data in db as well
to support persistent timers defined in the workflow.

=== Data management

Since workflows operate on database records (entities defined as data objects)
it has an option to manage these records. One of the important aspects is what
should happen to the data after workflow instance completes?

There are two options provided by Automatiko

- keep the data as they are at workflow instance completion
- remove data that the workflow instance has worked with

NOTE: By default data is not removed at the completion of workflow instance

== DynamoDB based storage

DynamoDB based storage allows to rely on Amazon managed DynamoDB. It allows to offload most of the storage
heavy lifting (such as replication, scalability etc) to managed persistence service.

Automatiko takes advantages of highly scalable nature of DynamoDB that nicely fits into workflow data model - being
key value based. 

Every workflow definition will be stored in dedicated table that is constructed
based on workflow identifier and version. That will result in each workflow definition to have 
dedicated storage location. Automatiko by default creates all required tables so there is no need
to dive into the details but if such need arise automatic table creation can be disabled.

The table structure will have following attributes

- *InstanceId* - (of type string) this is the unique id of each workflow instance
- *Content* - (of type binary) this is the actual workflow instance serialized
- *Tags* - (of type list) this is the workflow instance tags - it also includes `instance id` and `business key`
- *PIStatus* - current status of the workflow instance
- *VersionTrack* - current version of the workflow instance (increment with each change)

NOTE: In addition when table is created it assigns default values for read and write capacity set to 10, it can be
changed via configuration properties

== Apache Cassandra based storage

Apache Casandra based storage allows to rely on advanced distributed data store for highly available use cases.
It enables use of multiple data centers to replicate workflow instance data securely to make it available in
all available locations. 

Every workflow definition will be stored in dedicated table that is constructed
based on workflow identifier and version. That will result in each workflow definition to have 
dedicated storage location. Automatiko by default creates all required tables so there is no need
to dive into the details but if such need arise automatic table creation can be disabled.

The table structure will have following attributes

- *InstanceId* - (of type text) this is the unique id of each workflow instance
- *Content* - (of type blob) this is the actual workflow instance serialized
- *Tags* - (of type set) this is the workflow instance tags - it also includes `instance id` and `business key`
- *PIStatus* - current status of the workflow instance
- *VersionTrack* - current version of the workflow instance (increment with each change)

In addition to tables, Automatiko will create key space as well with configured name. If name is not given then it 
defaults to `automatiko`.

NOTE: Automatic keyspace creation is most basic setup as it uses `simple replication strategy` with replication
factor set to 1. For more advanced (production like) use cases key space should be created manually and its name
should be given via configuration.

Next to tables, each workflow definition will get an index to be able to query more efficiently.

== MongoDB based storage

Document databases are very popular and makes a good fit in cloud environments. MongoDB based persistence addon
allows to keep workflow information as a document. Most important part is that data objects of the workflow 
instance is stored as nested document and by that can be used as target of queries. 

Every workflow definition will be stored in dedicated table that is constructed
based on workflow identifier and version. That will result in each workflow definition to have 
dedicated storage location. Automatiko by default creates all required collections and default indexes
 so there is no need to dive into the details but if such need arise collections can be created up front.
 
The table structure will have following attributes

- *instanceId* - (of type text) this is the unique id of each workflow instance
- *content* - (of type binary) this is the actual workflow instance serialized
- *tags* - (of type set) this is the workflow instance tags - it also includes `instance id` and `business key`
- *piStatus* - current status of the workflow instance
- *versionTrack* - current version of the workflow instance (increment with each change)
- *variables* - a nested document that represents all variables

== Transaction log

IMPORTANT: Use of transaction log comes with performance penalty as it records to disk each activity 

When using persistence, regardless what is the actual data store (file system, Cassandra, DynamoDB, MongoDB etc) there is 
always a risk that the service might crash while performing operations and before the result of the operation is 
written to data store. 

At the same time, service can be one of the mission critical services that cannot effort to loose the work that was
in flight. To allow to have more fault tolerance support to avoid lost work a transaction log can be enabled in the service
to record individual steps and in case of a crash perform automatic recovery on next start of the service.

Transaction log records every activity of the workflow that is being executed and stores it in transaction log 
store. In case of a crash of the system, next start will look up into transaction log store to find in flight transactions.
Every in flight transaction found will be automatically recovered from the last activity recorded meaning it won't
re-execute already performed activities and resume from last one directly. No need to have administrators to do any
action to make this happen.

Worth noting is that recovery is done as part of the startup process which blocks and prevents from complete startup until
recovery is completed. This is done on purpose to ensure no requests get in the way during recovery. This is important from
health check probes point of view especially readiness check as it might lead to service being killed by orchestrator
(e.g. Kubernetes) during recovery. Recovery is usually very fast but if there are many instances to be recovered or the actions recovery starts from is 
blocking for long time it might affect overall startup time.

IMPORTANT: Configure readiness check accordingly to avoid intermittent pod evictions during long recovery.

=== Configuration

Transaction log is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled. Once enabled it must provide a folder location
where transaction logs will be written. This folder must be a persistent folder that will survive service crashes.

.Transaction log configuration parameters
|====
|Property name|Environment variable|Description|Required|Default value|BuildTime only

|quarkus.automatiko.persistence.transaction-log.enabled|QUARKUS_AUTOMATIKO_PERSISTENCE_TRANSACTION_LOG_ENABLED|Enables transaction log for workflows to always record activities that are performed to automatically recover after crash|No|false|No
|quarkus.automatiko.persistence.transaction-log.folder|QUARKUS_AUTOMATIKO_PERSISTENCE_TRANSACTION_LOG_FOLDER|Location on file system that will be used to store transaction log entries|Yes (if transaction log is enabled)||No
|====

=== Transaction log store

Transaction log records every activity execution and places that into transaction log store. Currently there is 
only one transaction log store based on file system that records individual instances grouped by transaction id.
It is not the most efficient storage option but already provides significant value but with more performance overhead.

Transaction log store can be provided by application developers by implementing 
`io.automatiko.engine.api.uow.TransactionLogStore` interface. In addition there are plans to also implement other
store implementation out of the box.

== Unit of work timeout

Automatiko by default does not limit the time allowed to perform operations by workflow engine. Meaning each operation that comes to the engine, regardless of the channel (REST api, Messaging etc) will be allowed to execute without any timeout.
This sometimes can lead to situations where the execution is block infinetely and thus locking resources. Especially important when messaging is involved as this will cause messages not be acknowledged and thus blocked.

Fault tolerance addon comes with timeout based UnitOfWorkManager that allows to to timeout operation when taking too long. By default it is configured with 300 seconds but can also be adjusted via configuration properties.

=== Use it

Add dependency to `automatiko-fault-tolerance-uow-addon` needs to be added to the project.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.automatiko.addons</groupId>
  <artifactId>automatiko-fault-tolerance-uow-addon</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This will immediately configure timeout based unit of work manager and thus will guard execution to not exceed 300 seconds.

To change the value use `quarkus.fault-tolerance.\"io.automatiko.addons.fault.tolerance.uow.TimeoutUnitOfWorkManager/execute\".timeout.value` property in your application.properties file with value expressed in seconds.
