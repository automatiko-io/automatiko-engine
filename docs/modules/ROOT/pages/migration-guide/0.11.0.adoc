= Migrate to 0.11.0

== Decision requires explicit dependency declaration

In version 0.11.0 to use DMN decisions there is a need to explicitly declare 
dependency to that module as it is no longer shipped with default configuration.

To use DMN decisions add following dependency to your service

[source.xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.automatiko.decision</groupId>
  <artifactId>automatiko-decision-dmn</artifactId>
</dependency>
