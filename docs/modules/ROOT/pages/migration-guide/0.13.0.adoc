= Migrate to 0.13.0

== GraphQL user task related endpoints renamed

A change has been introduced in naming GraphQL endpoints to allow use of the same task name across different workflow
definitions within the same project. It means that the generated GraphQL queries and mutations will include 
`process id` as part of the operation name. Below you can find an example showing before `0.13.0` and in 0.13.0` 
operation name. Note the `_requests` that is added.
