= Workflow as a Function (WaaF)

image::workflow-as-function.png[]

Workflow as a Function is dedicated for short lived operations that usually last
no longer that a second. They are expected to be fast and small in size both at runtime
and at boot time.

Workflow as a Function typically targets deployments in more constrained environments such as:

- link:https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda]
- link:https://cloud.google.com/run[Google Cloud Run]
- link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview[Azure Functions]

however are not strictly limited to them, as they can easily be invoked
over HTTP with both `POST` and `GET` endpoints, making them deployable virtually
anywhere.

TIP: Functions can map data from payloads (`POST`) as well as from query parameters
(`GET`).

Regardless of the number of activities it contains, the workflow is always
exposed as a single function with its id being its `public` identifier, namely the function name.

== Get started

To get started with Workflow as a Function users can take advantage of ready to use maven archetype
to generate the project structure

- *automatiko-function-archetype* - Tailored project type for workflow as a function use case


Here is a ready to use command to generate project based on *automatiko-function-archetype*

[source,plain]
----
mvn archetype:generate                                      \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=io.automatiko.archetypes               \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=automatiko-function-archetype       \
  -DarchetypeVersion=LATEST                                 \
  -DgroupId=com.acme.workflows                              \
  -DartifactId=workfow-function
----

Generated project has three maven profile defined that represents the target environment to deploy your function

- `azure` - for Azure Functions
- `gcp` - for Google Cloud Functions
- `aws-lambda` - for Amazon Lambda

== Configure project

Once the project is bootstrapped, it needs to be configured according to the needs. There are two places where 
configuration is done

- `pom.xml` - definition of the dependencies and Automatiko addons to be used
- `application.properties` - all configuration parameters are defined there (found in `src/main/resources` directory)

A complete configuration of Automatiko specific configuration parameters can be found here, Quarkus specific configuration
parameters can be found here.

=== Azure functions

Azure configuration uses `azure-functions-maven-plugin` and thus requires additional configuration to be set. 
Either by editing pom.xml file or using `-D` on the command lines. Here are the properties that must be set

- `functionResourceGroup` - resource group in your Azure subscription to be used
- `functionAppPlan` - application plan to be used

Once this is done Azure function deployment can be done via maven plugin

[source,plain]
----
mvn clean package azure-functions:deploy -Pazure
----

This command will give you as output a `HTTP Trigger Urls` that points to your function.

=== Google Cloud functions

For Google Cloud functions it should be build with `gcp` profile

[source,plain]
----
mvn clean package -Pgcp
----

And then deployed to your Google Cloud project using `gcloud`

[source,plain]
----
gcloud functions deploy automatiko-user-registration-example \
  --entry-point=io.quarkus.gcp.functions.http.QuarkusHttpFunction \
  --runtime=java11 --trigger-http --source=target/deployment
----

This command will give you as output a `httpsTrigger.url` that points to your function.

=== AWS Lambda

For AWS Lambda functions it should be build with `aws-lambda` profile

[source,plain]
----
mvn clean package -Paws-lambda
----

And then deployed to your AWS Lambda project using `sam`

[source,plain]
----
sam deploy -t target/sam.jvm.yaml -g
----

This command will give you output similar to following

[source,plain]
----
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outputs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key                 UserRegistrationFunctionApi
Description         URL for application
Value               https://xqe0c0addh.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----

The above url can be used to trigger lambda functions by appending the context path.
